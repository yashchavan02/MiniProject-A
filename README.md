## ⭕ Introduction

The Mobile Phone Purchase System is a simple console-based application designed to facilitate the purchase of mobile phones from various brands. It provides users with a menu-driven interface to select their desired brand, series, and model of mobile phone, along with displaying relevant information such as prices, features, and specifications. The system is implemented in C++ programming language.

   - Users can choose from five major mobile phone brands: `Apple` , `Samsung` , `Vivo` , `Oppo` , and `OnePlus` .

2. **Series Selection:**
   - Each brand offers multiple series of mobile phones, such as the iPhone series for Apple, Galaxy series for Samsung, and so on.
   - Users can select a series from the available options after choosing a brand.

3. **Model Selection:**
   - Within each series, users can select a specific model of the mobile phone they wish to purchase.
   - Models are categorized based on their variants like Base, Plus, Pro, and Pro Max.

4. **Order Placement:**
   - After selecting the desired model, users can place an order, which displays a confirmation message along with the chosen model's details.

## ⭕ Code Structure

1. **Main Function:**
   - The `main()` function serves as the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to start the purchase process and calls the `Show_Mobile_List()` function.

2. **User Interaction Functions:**
   - Functions like `Show_Mobile_List()` , `choose_Mobile_brand()` , and brand-specific functions `apple_mobile_series()` , `samsung_mobile_series()` , etc. handle user interactions and guide them through the purchase process.

3. **Model Selection Functions:**
   - Functions like `base_model()` , `plus_model()` , `pro_model()` , and `pro_max_model()` are responsible for handling model selection within each series.

4. **Price Calculation:**
   - Prices of mobile phone models are hard-coded within the program. Prices are determined based on the selected model and are displayed to the user during the purchase process.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - The program includes basic error handling mechanisms such as input validation and recursive function calls for reselection in case of invalid inputs.
