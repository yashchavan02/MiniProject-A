### ‚≠ï Introduction

The Mobile Phone Purchase System is a simple console-based application designed to facilitate the purchase of mobile phones from various brands. It provides users with a menu-driven interface to select their desired brand, series, and model of mobile phone, along with displaying relevant information such as prices, features, and specifications. The system is implemented in C++ programming language.

---

### ‚≠ï Features

1. **Brand Selection:**
   - Users can choose from five major mobile phone brands: `Apple` , `Samsung` , `Vivo` , `Oppo` , and `OnePlus` .

2. **Series Selection:**
   - Each brand offers multiple series of mobile phones, such as the iPhone series for Apple, Galaxy series for Samsung, and so on.
   - Users can select a series from the available options after choosing a brand.

3. **Model Selection:**
   - Within each series, users can select a specific model of the mobile phone they wish to purchase.
   - Models are categorized based on their variants like Base, Plus, Pro, and Pro Max.

4. **Order Placement:**
   - After selecting the desired model, users can place an order, which displays a confirmation message along with the chosen model's details.

5. **User Data Handling:**
   - User data such as the chosen model's price and name are passed to the `userData()` function for further processing.
   - This function can be extended to handle additional user-related tasks like storing order details or generating invoices.

---

### ‚≠ï Code Structure

1. **Main Function:**
   - The `main()` function serves as the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to start the purchase process and calls the `Show_Mobile_List()` function.

2. **User Interaction Functions:**
   - Functions like `Show_Mobile_List()` , `choose_Mobile_brand()` , and brand-specific functions `apple_mobile_series()` , `samsung_mobile_series()` , etc. handle user interactions and guide them through the purchase process.

3. **Model Selection Functions:**
   - Functions like `base_model()` , `plus_model()` , `pro_model()` , and `pro_max_model()` are responsible for handling model selection within each series.

4. **Price Calculation:**
   - Prices of mobile phone models are hard-coded within the program. Prices are determined based on the selected model and are displayed to the user during the purchase process.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - The program includes basic error handling mechanisms such as input validation and recursive function calls for reselection in case of invalid inputs.

### ‚≠ï Conclusion

The Mobile Phone Purchase System provides a convenient way for users to explore and purchase mobile phones from popular brands. With its intuitive menu-driven interface and detailed information about available models, users can make informed decisions about their purchases. The system can be further enhanced with additional features such as user authentication, payment processing, and order tracking to provide a more comprehensive purchasing experience.
